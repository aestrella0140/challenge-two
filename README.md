# Adrians Showcase Portfolio


## Description

I was motivated to make this project to start my professional career. A great professioanl portfolio is where it starts to show all you talent I have. This is what is going to represent me in the real world.
I built this project so i could show off what i could to even to the small details that add up to a great website. It'll show what I can do and i will be adding to it as I grow, So it will only get better.
This solves the problem of not having all the work ive done and all the knowledge I know and putting it all in to one Place rather than showing piece by piece.
I learned how to fit all the content into one webpage and keep it clean and pretty for visual likeness. I also learned how to link various contacts through which you can reach me and see ongoing and finished Projects.
